The Appropriate Box is a OpenWRT based Luci page that lists files on a device that are available for download, and allows users to upload their own files to that device.


To use:

1) Get the ip address of your current node. It will be the 10.XXX.XXX.XXX address.
```ip neighbor```


2) Run the make box script with that ip address as a argument.
```
$./make_box 10.114.207.1
```

3) Type in the nodes password when it is requested. This will happen at least 6 times.

4) Go to the address listed by the script when it is complete.
